## Intro

In the realm of education, NGOs stand as beacons of inclusivity, striving to provide knowledge to marginalized communities. This report unveils an innovative solution, "NGO Library Management System," designed to enrich the educational process within these organizations.

The system's core objective is to bolster library management for NGOs through technology-driven features. Volunteers can efficiently sign in and contribute by adding new students, expanding educational outreach. The system's unique capability lies in assigning age and level-appropriate books to students, optimizing their learning journey.

A standout feature is the personalized test generation based on student profiles, automatically evaluated through an NLP model. Gamification is harnessed via an appealing leaderboard, nurturing motivation and growth. The system ensures timely book returns through email notifications and introduces inverted book recommendations for diverse exploration.

Efficiency is elevated through a barcode scanner, tracking book borrowing and returns. This system harmonizes technology with education, amplifying NGOs' impact in fostering equitable access to education and knowledge


## Objectives

This report aims to comprehensively document the development and implementation of the "Library Management System for NGOs" project. The objectives of the report are as follows:

1.	Project Overview: Provide a clear and concise introduction to the project, outlining the significance of the "Library Management System for NGOs" in enhancing educational opportunities and resource management within nonprofit organizations.
2.	Feature Explanation: Detail the distinct features of the system, including volunteer sign-in, student addition, automated book assignment, custom test design, NLP-based answer correction, gamification through leaderboards, email notifications for overdue books, inverse book recommendations, and barcode scanning.
3.	System Design and Architecture: Present an in-depth analysis of the system's design and architecture. Describe the technical components, interactions, and data flow among various modules to give readers a clear understanding of the system's inner workings.
4.	Implementation Details: Provide insights into the technology stack used, programming languages, frameworks, and tools employed to develop the system. Discuss challenges faced during implementation and their resolutions.
5.	Functional Flow: Present a step-by-step walkthrough of how the system functions, from volunteer sign-in to the various stages of student management, book assignment, test creation, correction, gamification, notification, and book tracking.
6.	NLP Model Integration: Elaborate on the integration of the NLP model for automatic correction of student answers. Explain the model's functionality, training, and how it enhances the assessment process.
7.	Database Management: Discuss the database structure, schema, and management techniques used to efficiently store and retrieve user, book, and transaction data.
8.	Impact and Benefits: Evaluate the impact of the system on NGOs and the educational landscape. Discuss how the system contributes to resource optimization, personalized learning, and student engagement.
9.	Future Enhancements: Propose potential enhancements and features that could be integrated into the system in the future to further improve its functionality and utility.
    

##Problem Statement

Presently, transaction of books in the institutional libraries have been done manually in most cases, thereby taking more time for transaction like borrowing of books or return of books and also searching of member and books. Series of problems occur as a result of this thereby
resulting to inefficient library management. In most cases as a result of human error there maybe loss and damages of records due to not using a computerized system in the library. 

Nevertheless, the difficulty in the searching of books which could be termed to be inadequacy in book Management is a problem in the manual library thereby causing inefficiency and time consuming in the library. Also the problem of space consuming erupts after the number of records become large the space for physical storage of file and records also increases if no
computerized system is implemented as well as the issue of cost. Due to problem of lack of prompt information retrieval and time wastage in using the library. In addition due to the cumbersome, in this project computer approach will be used to solve these problems.
